// Button Debouncer
// 
// Description: Debounces buttons on a single port being used by the application.
// This module takes what the signal on a GPIO port is doing and removes
// the oscillations caused by a bouncing button and tells the application if
// the button(s) are debounced.
// 
// The debouncing algorithm used in this library is based partly on Jack
// Ganssle's state button debouncer example shown in,
// "A Guide to Debouncing" Rev. 3.
//
// An explanation of the concepts expressed in this library can be found here:
// http://www.ganssle.com/debouncing.htm

// MAX_BUTTON_CHECKS should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 255.
// 10 is a roundabout good number of checks to perform before considering a button 
// debounced.
// If this number is large, the Debouncer instantiation will consume more RAM and
// take more time to debounce but will reduce the chance of having an incorrectly
// debounced button.
// If this is small, the Debouncer instantiation will consume less RAM but will 
// be more prone to incorrectly determining button presses and releases.

        // Button Debouncer Process
        // Description:
        //      Does the calculations on debouncing the buttons on a particular
        //      port. This function should be called on a regular interval by the
        //      application such as every 1 to 10 milliseconds. 
        // Parameters:
        //      portStatus - The particular port's status expressed as one 8 bit 
        //                   byte.
        // Returns:
        //      None
        // Note:
        //      A good alternative way to use this function is to set up interrupts 
        //      for the buttons on a particular port and have this function called 
        //      after a button is pressed (and interrupts are temporarily disabled 
        //      for that button) then pass the initial state of the buttons and set 
        //      this function to be called on a regular interval thereafter until 
        //      the button(s) are released. The particular button's interrupt is 
        //      then re-enabled. With this method, computation time spent in 
        //      constantly checking the buttons when none have been pressed goes 
        //      unwasted.
        // 
        void ButtonProcess(uint8_t portStatus);

        // Check Button Press
        // Description:
        //      Checks to see if a button was pressed. The application should wait
        //      until a button is released before re-enabling any disabled button
        //      interrupts (if the button pins have interrupts attached to them).
        // Parameters:
        //      GPIOButtonPin - The particular bit on the port that needs to be 
        //                      read.
        // Returns:
        //      True if the button was pressed. False if it was not.

        //      until the button is released before re-enabling any disabled button
        //      interrupts (if the button pins have interrupts attached to them).
        // Parameters:
        //      GPIOButtonPin - The particular bit on the port that needs to be 
        //                      read.
